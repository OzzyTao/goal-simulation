# goal-simulation

A python simulation toolkit for testing goal/intent recognition algorithms in mobility study.

- Based on a widely used Agent-based modeling platform: [mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- Has the ability to work with scenes including grid space, network space and continuous Euclidean space.
- Includes a few path planning algorithms from robotics for movement generation.
- Implemented a few well-known goal recognition algorithms as benchmarks.
- Visual simulation available for grid space.
